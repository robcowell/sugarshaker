A day late reply.. 

But, the Synclock demosys has no out-of-the-box feature for that kind of screens. It's made for synclock stuff foremost.

However, it's not that hard to add for a separate screen:

runtime_init:
move.l $120.w,savetb
move.l #mytb,$120.w
rts

vbl:
move.w #$2700,sr ;Stop all interrupts
clr.b $fffffa1b.w ;Timer B control (stop)
bset #0,$fffffa07.w ;Interrupt enable A (Timer B)
bset #0,$fffffa13.w ;Interrupt mask A (Timer B)
move.b #1,$fffffa21.w ;Timer B data (number of scanlines to next interrupt)
bclr #3,$fffffa17.w ;Automatic end of interrupt
move.b #8,$fffffa1b.w ;Timer B control (event mode (HBL))
move.w #$2300,sr
rts

mytb:
rte

runtime_exit:
clr.b $fffffa1b.w
move.l savetb,$120.w
rts



You probably don't need to restore $120 either, the demosys does that at exit.

If all fails, I can help you with an example in a couple of weeks, much stuff to do before that.
